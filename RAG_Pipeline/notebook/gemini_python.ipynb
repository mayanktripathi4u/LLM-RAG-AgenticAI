The amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength.  This means blue light is scattered about 10 times more than red light.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Why not violet?** Violet light is scattered even more than blue light, but there are a couple of reasons why we see a blue sky instead of a violet one:\n",
